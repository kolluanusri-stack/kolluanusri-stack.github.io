## Personal Statement
*"The law is reason, free from passion."*  
Yet, my journey through the world of law has taught me that passion is what drives us to seek justice.  
As a third-year **BA.LLB. (Hons)** student at **SASTRA Deemed to be University**, I am on a quest‚Äînot just for knowledge, but for the power to effect change.  
My ambition is to harness the law as a beacon of hope for those who feel lost in the labyrinth of legal complexities.
